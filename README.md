# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification project! This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 different classes. The CNN architecture, preprocessing steps, and training process have been detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the Anaconda environment using `conda create -n cifar10-env python=3.8` and activate it with `conda activate cifar10-env`.
3. Install project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook cifar10_classification.ipynb`.
5. Follow the Notebook to understand the CNN architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
